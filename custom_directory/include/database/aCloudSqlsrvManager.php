/*********************************************************************************

* Description: This file handles the Data base functionality for the application.
* It acts as the DB abstraction layer for the application. It depends on helper classes
* which generate the necessary SQL. This sql is then passed to PEAR DB classes.
* The helper class is chosen in DBManagerFactory, which is driven by 'db_type' in 'dbconfig' under config.php.
*
* All the functions in this class will work with any bean which implements the meta interface.
* The passed bean is passed to helper class which uses these functions to generate correct sql.
*
* The meta interface has the following functions:
* getTableName()	        	Returns table name of the object.
* getFieldDefinitions()	    	Returns a collection of field definitions in order.
* getFieldDefintion(name)		Return field definition for the field.
* getFieldValue(name)	    	Returns the value of the field identified by name.
*                           	If the field is not set, the function will return boolean FALSE.
* getPrimaryFieldDefinition()	Returns the field definition for primary key
*
* The field definition is an array with the following keys:
*
* name 		This represents name of the field. This is a required field.
* type 		This represents type of the field. This is a required field and valid values are:
*      		int
*      		long
*      		varchar
*      		text
*      		date
*      		datetime
*      		double
*      		float
*      		uint
*      		ulong
*      		time
*      		short
*      		enum
* length	This is used only when the type is varchar and denotes the length of the string.
*  			The max value is 255.
* enumvals  This is a list of valid values for an enum separated by "|".
*			It is used only if the type is ?enum?;
* required	This field dictates whether it is a required value.
*			The default value is ?FALSE?.
* isPrimary	This field identifies the primary key of the table.
*			If none of the fields have this flag set to ?TRUE?,
*			the first field definition is assume to be the primary key.
*			Default value for this field is ?FALSE?.
* default	This field sets the default value for the field definition.
